Hello and welcome! 
<br>
<br> 
While I may have originally intended this website to be another way for employers to see my resume, I remembered I already had
a LinkedIn, and could therefore use this personal website for other things, namely making connections with other people, professional or otherwise.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, in addition to being a centralized place for saving things I've made and done, I see this website as a kind of profile on the internet. 
If you find anything interesting, and you'd like to reach out (contact in footer) and have a chat, whether its professional, intellectual, or because we like the same wind ensemble music, please do so! 
Happy to oblige.

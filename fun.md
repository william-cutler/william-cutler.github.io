subtitle: What I spend my free time on that's worth sharing
---

I firmly believe in the importance of hobbies, crafts, and personal pursuits that I can follow purely for its own sake. In addition to helping my mental and physical well-being, it enriches my life and is a great way to connect with people. The fact that some of these activities lead to things worth putting on here is icing on the cake!

Some things I'm into: Music, Hiking, Composing, Travelling, Squash, Tennis, Board Games, History

## Music

My main interest is music, especially playing instruments. You'll most often see me on clarinet, but I've picked up a few others along the way. I love wind instruments in particular because the tone and dynamics is directly related to your breath - it's a very intimate connection with the sound. I started out with strictly classical band music, but later in high school fell in love with jazz and theater music. In addition to playing in organized ensembles, I love to jam and improvise with friends.

### Instruments
* **Clarinet** - I know, 'Squilliam'. I've been hearing it since 4th grade...
* **Harmonica** - My latest joy, since I recently found out that you don't need a blues harmonica to play the blues
* **Classical Guitar** - I used to play ukulele but only cared for finger-picking, so I got the real deal in 2020. It's my favorite instrument to play solo.
* **Bass Clarinet** - Mostly for pit orchestras. Being the beat and the bassline that sets the tone for "Trapped" in the Addams Family was a core memory of senior year high school
* **Tenor Saxophone** - From my jazz era in 11th grade
* **Piano** - My first instrument, but I stopped playing for about 9 years before picking it up again in high school.
* **Recorder** - I brought one to a Boy Scout camp and played "The Rake Hornpipe" for a campfire once (look it up, you'll recognize it)

### Songs to Play
* "Blue Shades", Frank Ticheli, Clarinet
* "Andalucia", Ernesto Lecuona, Piano
* "Merry Go Round of Life" from Howl's Moving Castle, Joe Haisahi, Classical Guitar

Featured Performances:

WORK IN PROGRESS

### Compositions

I started really getting into composing over the pandemic, mostly clarinet quartets since that's what we were up to in wind ensemble at that time. Check out digital recordings on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-221550413). I'm most fond of "Clarinet Quarter #2" and "Ghibli-esque Piano".

## Writing
For all the things not on my Google Scholar (most of my things). Some for classes, some on my own.

A dystopian short-story with themes of government surveillance and unjust intrusion. Written for my 20Time project junior year of high school, it's my first go at creative writing.

A lot of the western U.S. was with my family in an RV growing up. It's a very different style of travel than your average fly and sight-see, but very rewarding to see everything from the ground. There's beauty in natural liminality.
